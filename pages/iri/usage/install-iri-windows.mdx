In order to install IRI, there are certain requirements to be considered.
It should be noted that IRI only works on 64-bit architectures.

- Java 8u66 or higher (Oracle)
- On Windows, make sure that Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable Update 3 is installed

## Ways to install IRI

### Download

The easiest and fastest way to get IRI is by getting the already
compiled version from Github. You can find the compiled version
on the release page on Github: <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/iotaledger/iri/releases" key="">https://github.com/iotaledger/iri/releases</ExternalLink>

### Compile yourself

If you choose to compile IRI yourself you are required to install maven.

<TerminalInput>{`git clone https://github.com/iotaledger/iri cd iri mvn clean compile && mvn package`}</TerminalInput>

This will then create a target folder, in which you will
find the compiled .jar (not the original one) which you
can then use.
